This project provides EASE extension modules to help scripting IDE and Team functionalities.

> EASE is a scripting environment for Eclipse.
> It allows to create, maintain and execute script code in the context of the running Eclipse instance. Therefore such scripts may manipulate and extend the IDE itself.
> See [https://eclipse.org/ease/](https://eclipse.org/ease/) for more details.

Note that for using the extensions it is mandatory to install the EASE Core plugins first.

Use the update site [https://halwax.github.io/eclipse-ease-ext/site](https://halwax.github.io/eclipse-ease-ext/site) to install the modules in your Eclipse IDE.
